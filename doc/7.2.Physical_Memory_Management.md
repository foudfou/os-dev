# 7.2 Physical Memory Management

**WIP**

Going back to the detected memory map

See for example [the linux for cleaning up the memory
map](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/f0e18b03fcafd8344539101f564ae358950ae892/arch/x86/kernel/e820.c#L83)


Note also the acpi region is reclaimable, i.e. it can be considered free, as
long as we don't need the ACPI tables stored there.

For simplicity, we'll only use the region of extended memory above 1MB,
i.e. starting at 0x100000.

Our kernel is loaded to memory address 0x1000, before being copied to high
memory 0x100000. For now, we load the kernel in a single chunk of maximum
512*40 bytes, 40 being the number of sectors loaded from disk. We could get the
size of our kernel from a bootloader like GRUB, which is able to load ELF
binaries. Or we can simply use our LD script `kernel.lds` to track the offsets
of our kernel start and end [^nullprog]:

```
/* kernel.lds */
    . = 0x100000;
    __k_start = .;

/* in C code */
extern char __k_start, __k_end; // use &__k_end !!
```

We now need to decide how we're going to organize memory for:

- our kernel's own usage, for example to track memory usage → kernel-reserved
  "kernel heap"
- free memory for paging, for user processes

It's not unusual that OSes choose to put paging information, like the frame
bitmap or the page descriptor array, after the end of the loaded kernel. This
also comes naturally as the kernel is loaded by GRUB to extended memory (> 1
MiB) [^sos] [^hux-kernel].

We'll also follow that design for now and our memory will look like this:

It is critical to understand the physical memory layout, during and after the
bootloader process, as it's easy to make mistakes in design choices that lead
to various hard-to-debug issues, like not loading enough of the bootloader or
the kernel, overriding code region while loading, stack clashing with kernel
code, etc.
