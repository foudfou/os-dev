Going back to the detected memory map

Note also the acpi region is reclaimable, i.e. it can be considered free, as
long as we don't need the ACPI tables stored there.

For simplicity, we'll only use the extended memory above 1MB, i.e. starting at 0x100000.

As of now, our kernel is loaded to memory address 0x1000 and has a size of
maximum 512*40 bytes: the number of sectors loaded from disk. We could get the
size of our kernel from a bootloader like GRUB, which is able to load ELF
binaries. Or we can simply use our LD script `kernel.lds` to track the offsets
of our kernel start and end:

```
/* kernel.lds */
    . = 0x1000;
    __k_start = .;

/* in C code */
extern char __k_start, __k_end; // use &__k_end !!
```

We now need to decide how we're going to organize memory for:

- our kernel's own usage, for example to track memory usage → "kernel-reserved"
- free memory for paging, for user processes → "kernel heap"

It's not unusual that OSes choose to put paging information, like the frame
bitmap or the page descriptor array, after the end of the loaded kernel. This
also comes naturally as the kernel is loaded by GRUB to extended memory (> 1
MiB) [^sos] [^hux-kernel].

We'll also follow that design for now and our memory will look like this:

| Addr            | Stuff                                          |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------|
|                 |                                                |
| 0x1000          | `__kstart` kernel start                        |
|                 |                                                |
| ???             | `__kend` kernel end                            |
|                 |                                                |
| 0x5000 (512*40) | max loaded kernel                              |
|                 |                                                |
| ??? (0x6000)    | `kheap_curr` start of kernel heap              |
|                 |                                                |
| 0x7c00          | boot_sect, can be used and overriden by kernel |
|                 |                                                |
| 0x7ffff         | `KHEAP_MAX_ADDR` end of "conventional memory"  |
|                 |                                                |
| 0x9f000         | end of first memory region                     |
|                 |                                                |

Maybe later, to give our kernel some working space, we'll start the kernel heap
at 1MiB instead.
