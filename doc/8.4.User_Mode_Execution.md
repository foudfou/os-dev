# 8.4 User Mode Execution

**Note**: this iteration is captured in the git tag `user-mode`.

We're able to create and run processes in kernel mode. But we ultimately want
to be able to switch back and forth between kernel and user mode execution, aka
*crossing the protection boundary*. Why? Well because it's a standard feature
of modern OSes 😀, but mainly because we want to protect our kernel from user
processes, and user processes from each other: restrict available instructions
and memory access.

We're not going to dive into [security features offered by the
CPU](https://wiki.osdev.org/Security#Low-level_Protection_Mechanisms). We
already saw paging for memory access. It's enough to mention *protection
rings*: processes can run in different rings (0-3), allowing different levels
of resource access. Ring-0 is meant for kernel, ring-1 and 2 for device
drivers, ring-3 for applications. OSes usually only use ring 0 and 3.

There are 2 parts to the challenge of implementing ring switching:

1. switch from kernel to user mode. We will use `IRET`, faking an interrupt.

2. switch from user to kernel mode. This is achieved via *system calls*
   (software interrupt) and TSS (Task State Segment).

## Getting to ring-3

This is the tricky part. So, in order to reach ring-3, we want to switch to a
new process, making the CPU believe it was already in ring-3, using an
interrupt. How does that work?

> [^hux-usermode]

Right, so what that means is engineering the new process's stack to return
multiple times, once via `iret`. That is as if we'd return from an
interrupt. This is where the *trap frame* (aka *trap state* in hux or
"interrupt state") machinery comes into play.

Here are all the ingredients:

- the new process stack includes:
  - a trap frame (`struct interrupt_state`) with mainly:
    - code and data segments with DPL=3
    - eflags with IF (interrupt enable)
    - eip to 0x0 (beginning of `initproc`)
  - a return address to `trapret`
  - a context (`struct context`) with eip pointing to `process_entry()` (xv6's
    `forkret()`)
- an assembly function `trapret` basically pops the trap frame and returns with
  `iret`. It's actually the last part of the existing `isr_wrapper` (xv6's
  `alltraps`).

So what happens now when the scheduler picks up `initproc` is:

1. `swtch()` pops the context, especially points at the new stack, and jumps to `process_entry()`.
1. `process_entry()` returns, i.e. pops eip which happens to be `trapret`.
1. `trapret` pops the trap frame (segment descriptors, registers) and does `iret`
1. since the "restored" code descriptor has DPL=3, we're now in user mode 🏆

Visually:

```
swtch (swap stacks) -RET->
  process_entry() -RET->
    trapret (pops fake interrupt state) -IRET->
      initcode (CPL=3)
```

> the IRET instruction pops the return instruction pointer, return code segment
> selector, and EFLAGS image from the stack to the EIP, CS, and EFLAGS
> registers, respectively, and then resumes execution of the interrupted
> program or procedure. If the return is to another privilege level, the IRET
> instruction also pops the stack pointer and SS from the stack, before
> resuming program execution. If the return is to virtual-8086 mode, the
> processor also pops the data segment registers from the stack. [^intel-x86]

Something striking about this design is the double return: why do we need
`process_entry()`? Spoiling a bit on future chapters, apart from releasing the
lock on `ptable`, we will need to do some initialization:

> `ret` starts executing `forkret`. On the first invocation (that is this one),
> `forkret` runs initialization functions [for the filesystem] that cannot be
> run from main because they must be run in the context of a regular process
> with its own kernel stack. [^xv6-book]

### Implementation considerations

A couple of details to watch out for:

- Making sure we get the trap frame right. We already adopted hux's trap frame
  format (`struct interrupt_state`) in [6.3 Handling
  Interrupts](./6.3.Handling_Interrupts.md). Note for example that the `ds`
  field is 32-bit. We populate it via EAX, which enables us to avoid padding
  like in xv6. Also the order of field groups in `isr_wrapper` (segment
  descriptors before general registers) differs from xv6, but that doesn't
  matter in practice since we control that order.
- Paying extra attention to how we inject segment descriptors (in
  `initproc_init()`) so they are "restored" correctly (in `trapret`). Otherwise
  we risk a triple fault (page fault). We know because we failed to restore DS
  properly at first.
- Segment descriptor SS does need to be set when preparing the trap frame:
  SS=DS. Remember? We're in protected mode, using paging. Segments are only
  useful for access management. Other segments (ES, FS, GS) are essentially
  unused; we nevertheless set them from DS in `trapret`, per our initial
  convention (`init_pm`).

#### Interrupt handling

Notice the process trap frame being setup with `eflags=IF` (interrupts
enabled): that's because we want to make sure interrupts are enabled when
entering user mode. In fact, right before `swtch`'ing to the process,
interrupts are already enabled (more on why in following chapters). But `iret`,
which is needed to switch to user mode, will not automatically re-enable
interrupts (since we're not in a exception or irq) and will also restore
`eflags` from the stack.

True that

> […] for Interrupt Gates, interrupts are automatically disabled upon entry and
> reenabled upon IRET, whereas this does not occur for Trap Gates.
> [osdev-idt](https://wiki.osdev.org/IDT#Gate_Types)

But this doesn't apply to the current situation which is a fake interrupt.

By the way, wouldn't be safer to disable interrupts (`cli`) in `trapret`? While
some OSes do it
([jamesmolloy](https://web.archive.org/web/20160326062442/http://jamesmolloy.co.uk/tutorial_html/10.-User%20Mode.html),
[OS_Mirror](https://github.com/amanuel2/OS_Mirror/blob/1a729774b3db8f2198b2ba27c06f3f1321f3b174/isr.asm#L9),
[ghaiklor-os-gcc](https://github.com/ghaiklor/ghaiklor-os-gcc/blob/5659e49231308e924c900727904ade385cff9ae3/cpu/interrupt.asm#L110)
for examples), the [general
consensus](https://discord.com/channels/440442961147199490/734392369230643320/1198086970895781958)
is that this is unnecessary and potentially source of bugs: just let an
interrupt happen between `trapret` and `iret`, execution will resume normally
after its completion. And indeed linux-0.1, 386BSD or SOS don't disable
interrupts.

Now, having implemented the corresponding machinery to get from ring-0 to
ring-3 — yet again mostly following xv6, our `initcode` program fails with page
fault. That's because, now it's started in user mode, it can't actually do
much: no interrupts (say to print something), no access to VGA memory (page
fault), no I/O to output to the serial port.

If we want to test and see the result of our work, apart from using a debugger,
we have to implement the return to ring-0 so `initcode` can make a system call
and have the kernel print something on its behalf.

## System calls

To get back from ring-3, we need:

- a TSS (Task State Segment)
- a system call interface: a dedicated trap interrupt.

> in essence this switches from the user's stack to your kernel stack.
> [^jamesmolloy]

So, to iterate, the way system calls work is:

- the user program issues a software interrupt (trap); it's pre-defined by the
  OS (0x40 / 64 in our case, 0x80 in Linux);
- because of the software interrupt, the CPU then restores the ring-0 stack from
  the TSS (SS and ESP from SS0 and ESP0). Note that in segmentation, the SS
  (*Stack Segment register*) stores the segment applied on ESP, so the stack
  pointer actually reads "SS:ESP". We set SS0 to the kernel data segment (index
  2) and ESP0 to the end of the process kernel stack.

Note the different mechanisms to switch privilege levels:
- ring-0 → ring-3: CS and DS in the trap frame for IRET.
- ring-3 → ring-0: TSS and software interrupt.

By the way wouldn't it be safer to disable interrupts for syscalls (maybe a
different `isr_wrapper`)? Again we are safely using a trap gate. After the `int
0x40`, the privilege switch is already complete, the stack switch will go
though the TSS, there's no functional badness we can get into.

### Syscall interrupt

According to our implementation of [interrupts](./6.3.Handling_Interrupts.md),
adding a trap requires additions in a few places:

- new entry in the `idt` table (`idt.c`), pointing to…
- new `isr_stub_64` function added in the `isr_stub_table` (`isr.asm`)
- new handler for syscalls in `isr_table` (`proc.c`)

For now our syscall handler will only print something to the screen.

### Task State Segment

When the init program triggers a syscall interrupt, the CPU will look for a TSS.

> TSS is a data structure holding information about a task.

We will dive into process stacks shortly. But for now what happens during a
software interrupt is:

> * SS0 gets the kernel datasegment descriptor (e.g. 0x10 if the third entry in your GDT describes your kernel's data)
> * ESP0 gets the value the stack-pointer shall get at a system call
> * IOPB may get the value sizeof(TSS) (which is 104) if you don't plan to use this io-bitmap further
> [osdev-tss](https://wiki.osdev.org/Task_State_Segment#TSS_in_software_multitasking)

Why the shift in `SEG_KDATA << 3` in the ss0 assignment again? Remember the
format of descriptors, aka *selectors* in segmentation: the index in the GDT is
in bits 15-3. So if we want index 2, we actually need 2<<3 (0x10) in the
descriptor.

Fun fact: the *80386 Programmer's Reference Manual* Intel Corp., 1986, ISBN
1-55512-022-9, shows a wrong format:

```
Figure 5-6. Format of a Selector

  15                      4 3   0
 ╔═════════════════════════╤═╤═══╗
 ║                         │T│   ║

 ╚═════════════════════════╧═╧═══╝

  TI - TABLE INDICATOR
  RPL - REQUESTOR'S PRIVILEGE LEVEL
```

Finally what is this field `uint16_t iomb`, aka IOPB, we set to 0xFFFF (hux
sets it to `sizeof(struct taskstate)`)? That's the *I/O Map Base* address
field. A 16-bit offset from the base of the TSS to the I/O Permission Bit Map.

> If I/O map base is greater than or equal to TSS limit, the TSS segment has no
> I/O permission map, and all I/O instructions in the 80386 program cause
> exceptions when CPL > IOPL. [^intel-x86]

Another way to protect I/O functions is the IOPL field in the EFLAGS register:
I/O instructions can be executed only if CPL ≤ IOPL.

### Process stacks

Now let's clarify something confusing: how many stacks does a process have, one
or two?

> Each process has two stacks: a user stack and a kernel stack
> (p->kstack). When the process is executing user instructions, only its user
> stack is in use, and its kernel stack is empty. When the process enters the
> kernel (for a system call or interrupt), the kernel code executes on the
> process’s kernel stack; while a process is in the kernel, its user stack
> still contains saved data, but isn’t actively used. A process’s thread
> alternates between actively using its user stack and its kernel stack. The
> kernel stack is separate (and protected from user code) so that the kernel
> can execute even if a process has wrecked its user stack. [^xv6-book]

So where are these process stacks defined? The user stack starts at the end of
the frame allocated for the process code and data (`p->tf->esp = PGSIZE`).
Real world OSes allocate virtual memory for each segment of an ELF program.
The kernel stack for the process is allocated when we create the process
(`p->kstack = kalloc()`). It is where we will setup the trap frame and where
execution is going to `swtch()` to on the way to ring-3. We also set tss ESP0
to the end of the stack (`mycpu()->ts.esp0 = p->kstack + KSTACKSIZE;`) for when
execution resumes to ring-0.

Reiterating, for each process, [2
stacks](https://stackoverflow.com/a/64922355/421846) effectively co-exist: the
one used by the user-level program, the one used by the kernel for the
user-level process.

## Progress so far

Wow this is the longest chapter so far! A lot to take in.

Now we have implemented the round trip ring-0 → ring-3, we can modify our first
user process `initcode` to make a system call (`int 0x40`), which will
effectively print something to the screen.

As there's not much more we can do for now, we'll have the process ending with
an attempt to `hlt`, which will trigger a protection fault. Note we can't
simply return at this stage: we haven't set any return address on the stack and
there will be some cleanup to do anyways.
