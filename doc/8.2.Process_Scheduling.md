# 8.1 Process Scheduling

## User mode execution

FIXME elucidate if/how a process runs alternatively in kernel and user mode.


Note, to [enter User Mode](https://littleosbook.github.io/#entering-user-mode)
`iret` must be used anyways:

> The only way to execute code with a lower privilege level than the current
> privilege level (CPL) is to execute an `iret` or `lret` instruction -
> interrupt return or long return, respectively. [^littleosbook]


### Process stacks

> Each process has two stacks: a user stack and a kernel stack
> (p->kstack). When the process is executing user instructions, only its user
> stack is in use, and its kernel stack is empty. When the process enters the
> kernel (for a system call or interrupt), the kernel code executes on the
> process’s kernel stack; while a process is in the kernel, its user stack
> still contains saved data, but isn’t actively used. A process’s thread
> alternates between actively using its user stack and its kernel stack. The
> kernel stack is separate (and protected from user code) so that the kernel
> can execute even if a process has wrecked its user stack. [^xv6-book]

FIXME where is the xv6 user stack defined? A: at the end of the process user
space as part of the *trap frame* `p->tf->esp = PGSIZE;`? So why does Hux
processes [effectively use 3
stacks](https://github.com/josehu07/hux-kernel/wiki/14.-User-Mode-Execution#a-quick-recap-of-system-state):
process kernel stack (`p->kstack`), process user stack (`p->stack_low`) and
kernel stack for the process (???).


I.e. for each process, [2 stacks](https://stackoverflow.com/a/64922355/421846)
effectively co-exist: the one used by the user-level program, the one used by
the kernel for the user-level process.


## Scheduler

FIXME maybe another chapter?
